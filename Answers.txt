Some of the solutions to this problem are counter-intuitive. To get a grasp for this, it is instructive to see what happens when the swimmer continuously applies the squirrel strategy:

With that in mind, here are my answers. Note that the images are drawn top-to-bottom, so 223.5° appears as 136.5°.

Puzzle 1
A. By moving directly away from the bear, until he is no longer gaining on the bear.
B. Initially, an arc of a circle, then a straight line
C. After 43.5° = 0.120833 full turns, from (-1.151,-1.094) towards 223.5°
D. 1.731 units of time. At that moment, he'll be 4.875 from the bear.
E. Yes, after swimming 3.645 (distance/time, they are identical as his speed is 1.0) and he'll be 0.895 away from the bear (the 'separation') as he leaves the pool:

Puzzle 2
A. Same as puzzle 1, 3.645  
B. 3.645 again, nothing is shorter than the radial. Dashed after 1.731 from (-1.151, -1.094) towards 221.6°
C. 3.519 and runs for the trees when he's 0.283 from the bear. Dashed after 0.510 from (-0.491, -0.122) towards 208.3°
D. One alternative strategy is to swim a logarithmic spiral, which if nothing else should confuse all but the smartest of bears. The fastest spiral gets him to the edge in 3.828 with a separation of 0.022:

So 2C is the best strategy.

Puzzle 3
A. Same as puzzle 1, 3.645  
B. 3.853, separation 1.528. Dashed after 1.731 from (-1.151, -1.094) towards 262.6°:

C. 4.481, separation 3.013. Dashed after 0.700 from (-0.652, -0.223) towards 317.7°:

D. The spiral with the best separation of is the same as 2D

So 3C is the best strategy.

Bonus 1
At 4.5 The swimmer gets eaten no matter what he does.

Bonus 2
4.4 is the maximum radius, he escapes in 5.59, leaving the pool with a separation of 0.013:
